            <h3>Ghana, The Gold Coast Country</h3>
            <p>
              Ghana was formerly called 'The Gold Coast' until it gained its
              independence in 1957 from the British. The independence movement
              was led by Kwame Nkrumah. It was called The Gold Coast because of
              the large supply of gold that the country has.
            </p>
            <p>
              The capital of Ghana is Accra but there are 16 regions all with
              their own capitals. Ghana is a peaceful country with lovely people
              and beautiful culture. When you visit the country, you can see the
              rich culture everywhere you go. There are a variety of foods to
              try whether on the streets or in the restaurants. There are also
              beautiful art museums to visit.
